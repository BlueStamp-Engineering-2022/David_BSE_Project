# A Robot that uses Computer Vision to Track a Ball
This robot will track a ball and it will follow the ball using a raspberry pi.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

# Starter Project: Useless Machine
  

For my starter project, I created the Useless Machine. What the useless machine does is when you flip the switch, the robot will flip the switch back. The Useless Machine uses a motor, a PCB (Printed Circuit Board), and battery to power the machine. The motor is the one that moves the arm so that it will flip the switch back. On the PCB there is the switch, two resistors, 2 screw terminals which can connect two or more conductors, but in this case it is connecting both the battery and the motor. The PCB also includes a LED which changes to green when the switch is flipped by a person and it turns red when the machine flips the switch. And lastly it also has a snap switch which basically stops the circuit. When the switch is flipped it will cause the motor to move which will move the arm to flip the switch again. While building this starter project some difficult aspect is soldering, since I have never soldered before and it was also difficult holding the components in place while also soldering. But something I enjoyed while building this project was putting everything together after finishing the circuit.
