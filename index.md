# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone: Chassis
  

For my first milestone I built the chassis for my main project. Using an arduino, sensor shield, and motor driver to control the speed at which the vehicle moves and the direction. On the robot I have two motors to move the wheels and these motors are connected to a motor driver which is then connected to and powered by a sensor shield that is attached to the arduino. On the motor driver there are 6 wires connecting the motor driver to the sensor shield. Two of the wires control the speed at which the motor will run and 4 will control which direction the motor will turn. The two wires that control the speed of the motors will be connected to a pwm pin so that it can be controlled using analogWrite. This means that when controlling the speed there are more options instead of just having the motors be off or max speed. The rest of the pins do not have to be connected to a pwm pin as it controls the direction at which the vehicle moves. While completing the first milestone, one major problem I ran into is that when I turn the robot on while it is connected to my computer, my computer will automatically shut down, this is because when I turn the robot on, it is putting 5 volts into my computer.

# Starter Project: Useless Machine
  

For my starter project, I created the Useless Machine. What the useless machine does is when you flip the switch, the robot will flip the switch back. The Useless Machine uses a motor, a PCB (Printed Circuit Board), and battery to power the machine. The motor is the one that moves the arm so that it will flip the switch back. On the PCB there is the switch, two resistors, 2 screw terminals which can connect two or more conductors, but in this case it is connecting both the battery and the motor. The PCB also includes a LED which changes to green when the switch is flipped by a person and it turns red when the machine flips the switch. And lastly it also has a snap switch which basically stops the circuit. When the switch is flipped it will cause the motor to move which will move the arm to flip the switch again. While building this starter project some difficult aspect is soldering, since I have never soldered before and it was also difficult holding the components in place while also soldering. But something I enjoyed while building this project was putting everything together after finishing the circuit.
